Hi, I'm Carson Bates, I'm a middle schooler who likes programming.

I know Python, C++, Godot, and a bit of a few others.

My game team won the Oregon Game Project Challenge (OGPC) twice in a row so far, you can check out our website at https://epimetheus.games.
I'm also working on making a 2D game engine in Python -- https://github.com/epimetheusgames/Titan -- feel free to try it out if by the time you're reading this it's actually usable.

Hopefully you find some of my stuff interesting.

Cheers!

P.S. More contributions = more rizz
