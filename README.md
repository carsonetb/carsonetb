Hi, I'm Carson Bates, I'm a middle schooler who likes programming and making games in Godot.
I only ask questions in internet searchable forums, and so should you.

My game team won the Oregon Game Project Challenge (OGPC) twice in a row so far, you can check out our website at https://epimetheus.games.

Hopefully you find some of my stuff interesting.

Cheers!
